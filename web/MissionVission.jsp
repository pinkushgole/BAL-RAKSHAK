            <p style="font-size: 30px;font-family: cursive;" class="mt-2">Our vision is to provide CARE, OPPOTUNITIES and a life with DIGNITY to the helpless children who are working as begar and also engaged in unethical and unheiginic work.
So that they would get a better life and availability of essential comodities and services which every individual must have to life a life with dignity and respect. Also we want to see our country 
free from taboo of begar practices. This will not only improve the life of individuals but will also improve the socio-economic status of the country at the world level.
This will provide us a greater workforce engaged in economic participation and huge amount of reduction in count of child begar and unemployment rates. This step will further
glorify the image of India on the global plateform for taking such more initiatives for reducing and eleminating poverty and begar from the society(worls as a whole). </p>
